# üßë‚Äçüéì About Me
+ I received the B.Eng degree in optoelectronic information science from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](uestc.edu.cn) in 2023 and I have won more than thirty university-level awards during the undergraduate period. Also, I was awarded as an excellent graduates concerning my contributions to the security of Internet of Things. 
+ Now I am a Ph.D. student of [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](cuhk.edu.cn) in computer and information engineering, supervised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/yinfeng) and [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang (IEEE Fellow)](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/changtsunghui). My future research will focus on Network Security, Wireless Sensing, Signal Processing, as well as the Machine Learning Methods.
+ For more information, please refer to the latest [CV](http://xyhuang-cuhk.github.io/docs/Xinyu Huang_CV.pdf.

[Identify Selective Forwarding Attacks Using Danger Model: Promote the Detection Accuracy in Wireless Sensor Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9755128)

[Project](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=cuDwCOwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=cuDwCOwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='cuDwCOwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'></span></strong>
- We proposed a multi-level detection scheme inspired by human immune system against selective forwarding attacks in WSNs. 
- The detection accuracy and the false alarm rate are much lower than other effective methods.
- We also reduced the computation complexity to $$O(n)$$.
