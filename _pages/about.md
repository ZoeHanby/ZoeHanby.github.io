# üßë‚Äçüéì About Me
+ I received the B.Eng degree in optoelectronic information science from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](uestc.edu.cn) in 2023 and was awarded as an honorable graduates concerning my contributions to the security of Internet of Things. 
+ Now I am a Ph.D. student of [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](cuhk.edu.cn) in computer and information engineering, supervised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/yinfeng) and [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang (IEEE Fellow)](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/changtsunghui). My future research will focus on **Network Security, Wireless Sensing, Signal Processing**, as well as the **Machine Learning Methods**.
+ For more information, please refer to the latest version of my [CV](/files/CV.pdf).

[Identify Selective Forwarding Attacks Using Danger Model: Promote the Detection Accuracy in Wireless Sensor Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9755128)

**Xinyu Huang**, Yuanming Wu

[Project](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=cuDwCOwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=cuDwCOwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='cuDwCOwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'></span></strong>
- We proposed a multi-level detection scheme inspired by human immune system against selective forwarding attacks in wireless sensor networks. 
- The detection accuracy and the false alarm rate are much lower than other effective methods, which are all below 3%.
- We also reduced the detection complexity to $$O(n)$$ which is much lower than other ML methods.

[LSTM-NV: A Combined Scheme against Selective Forwarding Attack in Event-Driven Wireless Sensor Networks under Harsh Environments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197623006255)

**Xinyu Huang**, Shunan Li, Yuanming Wu

[Project](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=cuDwCOwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=cuDwCOwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='cuDwCOwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'></span></strong>
- Utilizing LSTM model to learn from normal data and predict for each node‚Äôs forwarding behavior.
- Adaptive thresholds are employed to identify local anomaly points.
- A novel neighbor-voting method has been designed to enable self-adaptive detection.
- Time-variant harsh environments within the network are taken into consideration.
